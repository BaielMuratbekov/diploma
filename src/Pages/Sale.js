          A coffee bean is a seed of the Coffea plant and the source for coffee.
          It is the pip inside the red or purple fruit often referred to as a
          cherry. Just like ordinary cherries, the coffee fruit is also a
          so-called stone fruit. Even though the coffee beans are not
          technically beans, they are referred to as such because of their
          resemblance to true beans.
