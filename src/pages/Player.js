            A coffee bean is a seed of the Coffea plant and the source for
            coffee. It is the pip inside the red or purple fruit often referred
            to as a cherry. Just like ordinary cherries, the coffee fruit is
            also a so-called stone fruit. Even though the coffee beans are not
            technically beans, they are referred to as such because of their
            resemblance to true beans.
